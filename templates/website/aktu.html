		<h2> HISTORY:</h2>
<p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), formerly Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU), is a public collegiate university in Lucknow in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

 <br>
 <br>
<br>The university was bifurcated into the Mahamaya Technical University and Gautam Buddha Technical University as of 1 May 2010 for better management of education in the state.

<h2>OVERVIEW:</h2>
<p>The university is affiliating in nature and its jurisdiction spanned the state of Uttar Pradesh. It is one of the largest technical universities in India and perhaps in Asia. Because of its size, the number of colleges affiliated to it, and geographic dispersion, it is sub-divided into five zones with 45â€“50 colleges in each zone for the ease of management and facilitating inter-zonal comparison and possible internal competition to enhance quality of teaching-learning processes.

<br>
<br>
<br>The university envisioned to facilitate and nurture quality technical education and research in its own premises as well as all affiliated institutions. There were 49 affiliated colleges in 2000, now in August 2019, 785 colleges and institutions. The task of the university included conducting the SEE-UPTU for admission to programs affiliated to it. The university conducted central examinations each semester for all the affiliated colleges and institutions. Results were declared using technology-enabled systems. At present, August 2019 around 4,00,000 students are enrolled in its programmes. The medium of instruction and examination is English.

<br>
<br>As per a dipstick study conducted by MeritTrac in association with UPTU Watch magazine, the engineering talent pool of the university was found to be significantly better than the national average.
